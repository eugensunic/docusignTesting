*Demo*
- show the actual flow with cypress 10, open any page and navigate to docusign, a new tab should open thus 
removing cypress framework thereby disabling further test automation
- provide an empty object as a response {} and see what happens
- remove the docusign code for the pageInFrame method, the navigation should work
- Cypress 12 has solved this issue.
